Number Munchers Proposal

*What is Number Munchers?*
An educational game for kids that teaches basic math skills, which I played a lot when I was younger.  The game is basically a 5x6 grid of numbers, and you are told to find and select all of the numbers that meet X criteria (i.e. all prime numbers, all multiples of 3, all factors of 15).  

Finding all of the correct answers will bring you to the next level, and each correct answer will add to your score.  Selecting an incorrect answer will cause you to lose a life.  Players start with 4 lives, and game is over once they hit 0.

*Initial thoughts on game structure*
The real version of the game has 'enemies' that appear on screen and move around.  Running into the enemies loses a life.  This is probably not going to be in my initial scope, but I'd like to add it if time allows.

The only other real difficult part I see is around the logic.  Assuming that there will be three different types of game board (prime, factors, multiples), what numbers should I put on the board for each, and what criteria will correspond for these board types.  Should the game get more challenging as you complete boards?  This would require even more logic.  

Last, not sure if I'll have a high score

*Phases of Completion*
1) Create the logic in straightforward fashion
2) Refactor Logic
3) Create the visuals
4) Add bells and whistles *optional*
